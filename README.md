# langchain_pinecone_document_chatbot

This project was generated using fastapi_template.

## Poetry

This project uses poetry.

To run the project use this set of commands:

```bash
poetry install
poetry run python -m langchain_pinecone_document_chatbot
```

This will start the server on the configured host.

You can find swagger documentation at `/api/docs`.

You can read more about poetry here: https://python-poetry.org/

## Docker

You can start the project with docker using this command:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . up --build
```

If you want to develop in docker with autoreload add `-f deploy/docker-compose.dev.yml` to your docker command.
Like this:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.dev.yml --project-directory . up --build
```

This command exposes the web application on port 8000, mounts current directory and enables autoreload.

But you have to rebuild image every time you modify `poetry.lock` or `pyproject.toml` with this command:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . build
```

## Configuration

This application can be configured with environment variables.

You can create `.env` file in the root directory and place all
environment variables here.

All environment variables should start with "AI*SERVICE*" prefix.

For example if you see in your "langchain_pinecone_document_chatbot/settings.py" a variable named like
`random_parameter`, you should provide the "langchain_pinecone_document_chatbot_RANDOM_PARAMETER"
variable to configure the value. This behaviour can be changed by overriding `env_prefix` property
in `langchain_pinecone_document_chatbot.settings.Settings.Config`.

An example of .env file:

```bash
langchain_pinecone_document_chatbot_RELOAD="True"
langchain_pinecone_document_chatbot_PORT="8000"
langchain_pinecone_document_chatbot_ENVIRONMENT="dev"
```

## Pre-commit

To install pre-commit simply run inside the shell:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

pre-commit is very useful to check your code before publishing it.
It's configured using .pre-commit-config.yaml file.

By default it runs:

-   black (formats your code);
-   mypy (validates types);
-   isort (sorts imports in all files);
-   flake8 (spots possible bugs);
